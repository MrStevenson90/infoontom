        <p>I was born and raised in the Western Suburbs of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, where I lived a life full of contrastsâ€”from playing rugby league in gritty, working-class areas to wearing a tie to school in more affluent neighborhoods. This unique upbringing shaped my worldview from a young age, preparing me for a life filled with diverse experiences.</p>
        <p>At my core, I am an artist. This perspective has guided me through various roles and industries. My career has swerved into finance and law which was a helpful stepping stone to understanding how to bring my bigger visions to life. </p>
        <p>My artistic journey has some milestones: I've produced a feature film that premiered to a full house, Played Guitar on a recorded that was regularly played on the radio, and set up both a record label and a studio. Beyond the arts, I've made my mark in the sports world by founding a rugby competition and have innovated in the industrial sector by overhauling a Connecticut steel yard with cutting-edge software and production flows to increase productivity. It's been a fun journey.</p>
        <p>My professional philosophy is founded on the principles of exploration, seeking challenges, and minimizing distractions. I'm a staunch believer in the 10,000 hours rule, advocating for intensive dedication to one's craft, which often means working late into the night and on weekends. My experiences have reinforced my belief that the USA, especially California (SF,LA), is the best place to make a meaningful impact on the world.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am dedicated to "Llama v Unicorn," a project aimed at providing a social alternative to traditional gambling mechanisms like slot machines and simulated sports betting. By creating real sports leagues and offering minutely markets, this initiative seeks to engage predictive gamers in an innovative way.</p>
        <p>Looking forward, my goal is to establish a business that uses sports probability as a gateway to financial education.</p>
        <p>I share a simple, fulfilling life with my partner, Meaghan, and our dog, Brizzie, in the Bay Area. Together, we enjoy work and spending time outside in the summer.</p>

                <p><strong>Kept Low Mowing</strong></p>
                Upon leaving school I started my first business. Working with a friend we built up to 50+ reoccuring customers before selling our route for far less then it was worth :)</p>

                <p><strong>Musician</strong></p>
               I was forturnate enough to experience the life and times of a struggling muscian in Australia. We got played on the radio and toured the East Coast a few times
                    These were fun years but ultimately unsustainable when you lack talent. Truth hurts.

                <p><strong>Sound Engineer & Record Producer.</strong></p> 
                Founded my second business. Working in all facets of the music industry from concert promoter to the studio and everything in between
                    This was a great experience. I was fortunate to learn from working with ARIA Award Winning Producer, Magoo - one of Australias most successful Record Producers.

                <p><strong>Law Clerk - Property & Criminal Law Team</strong></p>
                    At the age of 23, I thought I was so old and experienced. I enrolled in university and got a real job in a Law Firm. After a year of working my way up from pushing trolleys for lawyers to then working extensively on Criminal and Property Matters, I worked out that I had more to offer.

                <p><strong>Traveled India & South East Asia</strong></p>
                    I was drawn to India from a young age and to travel through Chennai, Bangalore, Mumbai and Goa opened my mind to how small we are as humans but also to what was possible. I got lost on my motorbike a few times and nearly died a few more.

                    Returning from South Asia, I began working on a film as the Writer, Director and Producer. It premiered to a sold out theatre in Brisbane Australia.

                <p><strong>Coming to America</strong></p>

                    In 2017, I got the opportunity to come to the US to play Rugby. After my three months were over, I decided to stay and purpose a career. 
                    I had a whole bunch of fun jobs in my early time here from deliverying chicken nuggets to carpentary. I played Rugby with White Plains Rugby, Harvard Business School and more.

                <p><strong>Eastern Metal Works - Production Manager</strong></p>

                    I started at Eastern Metal Works in Milford CT in early 2018 after the company had won a big contract and was adapting to how to manage the flow of steel and the organization of processes. I worked with world class project managers to implement FabSuite Software, Stock Taking $M of dollars of previously unused steel and setting processes for steel managment.

                    At the start of 2020 when the world changed, I went all in on learning about how the capital and venture markets work. My key take away is that the best trade or investment is in yourself and building from 0 has the potnetial for the highest returns. 
                    I interviewed with a big wealth management fund, it brought back the same fear of my law firm days. At this point I have accepted it will be difficult for me to work for someone else.
